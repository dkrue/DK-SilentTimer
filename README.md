# DK-SilentTimer
I made an Arduino based animated timer out of a decorative metal holder from an oil diffuser. This made a great upcycled gift to someone who works in a quiet environment.

## How it works
Flip the timer upside down, and a red LED on the LED ring will increment once per second. One second equals one minute.  To set the timer for 5 minutes, invert the timer for 5 seconds. 

When the timer has been activated, it displays an animated blue/green cascading effect. When the timer ends, a flashing white LED chase effect plays.

To give a nice ambient effect, a gentle soft-white animation plays when in idle mode.

## Ingredients
An inexpensive Pro Micro board, a 24 RGB LED 5050 ring, a cheap tilt sensor, and a metal oil/candle holder with a paper insert. I used a USB cable with a power toggle switch on it.
